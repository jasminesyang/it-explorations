# IT-Exploration
IT Exploration was a foundational course at Western Technical College that immediately immersed me in the core principles of my program. The class was designed for hands-on learning, providing practical projects that reinforced theoretical understanding. We moved efficiently from structured content, such as Cisco networking fundamentals, to broader assignments covering diverse software, hardware configurations, and coding languages.

One of the most valuable and rewarding assignments was successfully booting a live instance of Linux from a USB drive on a Windows machine. This practical application solidified my technical skills and served as a powerful reminder of the potential for accomplishment when I actively commit to trying new things and challenging my boundaries.
